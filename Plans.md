# Current plans:
- Improve responsiveness by alerting user when timestamp is added successsfully.
- Implement 'About' information popup.
- Sort videos and timestamps.
- Implement filter searching for videos.
- Add a time slider selector so that user can add a timestamp manually.
- Highlight current playing Video

# Known bugs:
- Extension still allows adding of timestamp when the YT video page has error (e.g. Private Video)
