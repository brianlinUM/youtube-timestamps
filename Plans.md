# Current plans:
- Change font
- Ability to Export / Import timestamps from csv
- Ability to import timestamps from Youtube video description
- Improve appearance of video list.
- Ability to set loops of a set duration starting at a given timestamp
- Checkboxing for deletion (instead of a delete button for each timestamp)
- Shortcuts to move to next/previous timestamp of current video

# Known bugs:
- Extension still allows adding of timestamp when the YT video page has error (e.g. Private Video)
