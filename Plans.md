# Current plans:
- Change font
- Ability to import timestamps from Youtube video description
- Improve appearance of video list.
- Ability to set loops of a set duration starting at a given timestamp
- Checkboxing for deletion (instead of a delete button for each timestamp)
- Shortcuts to move to next/previous timestamp of current video
- Add bootstrap to npm instead of in dist
- Button to restore original title of video
- Separate Chrome API code from rest of extension code, to make it easy to port to firefox (possible future plan)
- Prevent overwriting timestamp when adding, if already exists.

# Known bugs:
- console error: sometimes when loading video tab then clicking on timestamp. "Error: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist."
